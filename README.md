<H1>Instructions:</H1>
<br>

<H3><em>Stages 1 - 4</em></H3>
<br>

<p>In order to run stages 1 through 4 user must run Main.java file,
  This will allow for functionality through the terminal and will give the user options which were specified
  in the previous stages. <em>In order to use GUI a different approach must be taken as shown below: </em>
</p>

<br>

<H3><em>Stage 5</em></H3>
<br>
<p>However if you would like to run the fifth stage which includes the GUI 
   user must run the MazeRunner.java file as the main file and place the Main.java
   file into a seperate folder  or completely leave it out since MazeRunner.java contains a main function as well.
