**Abstract:**

Mazes are absolutely amazing! Imagine the thrill of running, avoiding enemies and obstacles,
and that gratifyingly triumphant feeling of reaching the exit if you can! Besides being a loads of fun,
maze games are actually valuable learning tools for children and adults alike.
Maze solving games has numerous benefits including but not limited to:
1) Improvement of patience and persistence in players.
2) The enhancement of cognotive and deductive reasoning abilities.
3) Excellent in the improvement of hand-eye coordination.
4) Development of memory improvement and strategic planning.

**Project Details:**

The project will be broken up into several stages with the purpose of accomplishing differnt tasks.
Here is a break down of the steps in sequence:
<br/>

Stage #1: At this stage, it does not matter what maze you display. The program may always output the same prepared maze or one of a set of prepared mazes.
     
      The maze sould follow the rules below:
      
        a. The maze will be implemented as a two-dimensional array of integers.
        b. If the value of an element is 1, it is a wall. If the value is 0, it is a passage.
        c. The dimensions of the maze must be 10 X 10.
        d. There should be walls around the maze, except for two cells: entrance and exit.
        e. Any empty cell should be accessible from the entrance or exit of the maze.
        f. It is impossible to move diagonally, only vertically or horizontally.
        g. There must be a path between the entrance and exit and they are interchangeable.
        h. After starting the program it should simply output a maze then stop.
